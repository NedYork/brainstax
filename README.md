BrainSTAX - The Ultimate Learning Accelerator.

BrainSTAX is a single-page web app built on a Ruby/Rails backend and ReactJS frontend. It's a flash-card study app which implements a unique spaced-repetition algorithm that dynamically resequences a user's set of flashcards based on the user's familiarity with each card.
